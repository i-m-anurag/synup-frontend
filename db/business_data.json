Roasting Plant Coffee was founded by Mike Caswell in his garage with the invention of JavabotTM, an in-store roasting and brewing system that automatically roasts coffee in every Roasting Plant caf\u001a?, and quickly brews every custom cup to order. Mikes love and experience in coffee (from Coffee Connection in Boston to Starbucks corporate in Seattle) and his deep understanding of engineering and business process led him to develop Javabot. This state of the art system roasts in micro-batches in every store and transports beans through tubes using air or pneumatics.",

    "description": "About American Appliance American Appliance, Inc. was established in 1990 and was originally opened in a much smaller storefront located at 49th St N in St. Petersburg, Florida. Less than a year after opening our doors, our experience in the industry, loyal customer base, & word-of-mouth referrals allowed us to expand our growing business into our current location on 54th Avenue North. It is here that we have served our community for over 33 years. In 2006, American Appliance, Inc. proudly constructed a new 7,500 sq. ft. showroom and warehouse at our same location. This new facility allowed us to continue to provide our customers with the same low prices, quality appliances, and individualized service that they have come to expect from us.",

Residents interested in activities outside our campus often travel to one of Springfield\u001a??s beautifully manicured parks, take advantage of the many shopping and dining venues, or even visit the local preschool to visit with young children in the community. And because we know that selecting the right care to meet your individual needs is important, we not only provide Assisted Living, specialized Memory Care and a variety of Short-Term Care options in our campus, we also offer Independent Living apartments for those seeking a more independent lifestyle.",

    "description": "Since 2001, Silver Trading Company has offered high volume sales of gold, silver, platinum and palladium to serious investors around the world. We also purchase metals.Larry LaBorde founded Silver Trading Company LLC in 2001 after becoming interested in gold and silver as investments. The closely held firm delivers high volume, investment grade gold, silver, platinum and palladium to private and corporate clients around the world. Larry and his small staff take pride in offering very competitive commissions and fees and in delivering warm, friendly service that is attentive, respectful and discreet. We have found that a little Southern hospitality goes a long way. We welcome and are grateful for your business. We are very pleased to have maintained an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. Larrys interest in precious metals originated at age eight, when he made his first trade after learning that the new 1965 coins were made with far lower silver content than earlier coins. He promptly exchanged new coins for older, more valuable coins that he gathered from the tellers at the bank where his dad was a board member and from the lunch ladies at school. He was thrilled at having spotted such a rich opportunity because of a stupid move by the government, and his fate as a metals broker was sealed. In high school, recruiters from MIT and the Naval Academy came calling, but Larry had already made the decision to marry his sweetheart and follow in his fathers footsteps in the water well drilling business, so he went to Louisiana Tech University and trained as a civil engineer. After college, he returned to Shreveport and took over operations of the family business. He is active, along with his four brothers, in both the water well drilling business started by his father and a water well supply business. Larry enjoys traveling with his wife of 35 years and racing dinghy-sized sailboats. He is active in the Shreveport Lions Club and the McNeill Street Pump Station preservation effort. An avid student of monetary history and U.S. history and politics, he is the author of Libertorn: Hope and Heartache for Americas Future (in press).Larry and his wife, the lovely Miss Puddy, have two grown children and live in Shreveport, Louisiana (USA) with Gracie, a border collie who likes to bark at the second hand of the wall clock, and Abbie, a golden retriever who looks sweet and innocent in between stealing treats. When not traveling, studying or playing with the dogs, Larry occasionally goes on mini-adventures with Miss Puddy to do things like jump out of a perfectly good airplane. Speaking engagementsLarry frequently speaks to business and civic groups about monetary history, fiat currency and related issues. To inquire about having Larry speak at your event, please email him at llabord@gmail.com.",

    "description": "In 1880, brothers Frank and Joe Conklin opened \u001a??The Pacific Steam Carpet Cleaning and Renovating Works\u001a?? on Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco. Carpet cleaning and renovation were conducted in the company plant; carpet was picked up and delivered by wagon, pulled by a pair of mules. When the Conklin brothers retired, Joseph Emmons and his son Jack took over the business and grew it into a retail floor covering chain, keeping the Conklin Bros. name. In 1963, Richard Oderio bought the Conklin Bros. franchise in San Jose. He spent the next 25 years working industriously on both his business and his philanthropic pursuits in the community. Richard retired in 1989, at which time his son Rick took the helm as President.",
